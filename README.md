# SP24-Differences-In-Misleading-Data-Collection-And-Financial-Dishonesty-In-Social-Media

Dark patterning is the inherited problem of many social media platforms and websites aimed at
collecting data of consumers unknowingly, dishonest financial transactions, and malicious user
agreements. Dark patterns are deceptive elements planted into web applications tricking users into
giving up personal information, money, and valuable data. Many outlets are used to derive
information from their users such as persistent ads, deceiving cookie banners, misleading user
agreements, and a multitude of user agreements aimed to have users auto agree to information
unknowingly. Not only are malicious methods used to collect data unknowingly, but some web
services are collecting more revenue by adding hidden fees or other expenses to online shopping
transactions, often going unnoticed by the consumer. Even when individuals were aware of the
potential of misleading media, many fell into the same trap. The types and magnitude of dark
patterning are rapidly increasing as the use of online media grows exponentially validating the
need for research in identifying and preventing such data exploitations.
